"""
Run this inside a git repo to check the latest commit, and find all the files that contain
"test" or "tests" in their filepaths. 

Use case: 
When I work on a new feature etc, I usually include my business logic changes and test changes
in a single commit. When getting peer review, sometimes I have to change the business logic. Once I do, 
I add the changes back to the original commit with git commit --amend. I should be able to validate
my commit still passes the tests before I submit a new version to be reviewed. It should also have no
external dependencies since some developers cannot download stuff via PIP in their development enviornments.

Setup:
You should have a '.testme' folder inside the base of the repo with an executable file called
'test_runner' which takes the absolute path of a test as an arg, and runs the test, returning 0 if successful.

Add the folder this file is in to your path, e.g. 

export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Tools/TestMe/testme"

Bugs:
This probably won't work if the latest commit _removes_ tests, as it will think the tests are there are try
to run them. I wouldn't put this as a post-commit hook or anything unless this gets fixed.

This has 0 external dependencies :) Useable anywhere you can download python3
